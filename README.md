Hi, I'm Manasi Shidhaye, a data analyst with a unique background in physical therapy. My journey began in healthcare, where I developed a deep understanding of patient care, clinical processes, and operational efficiency. Over time, I became increasingly interested in how data could drive better decision-making in healthcare and beyond.

This curiosity led me to pivot into data analytics, where I now specialize in uncovering insights through SQL, Python, and data visualization tools like Tableau. With my experience in both clinical and analytical settings, I bring a fresh perspectiveâ€”bridging the gap between complex data and actionable solutions.

Through my work, I aim to transform raw data into meaningful insights that drive business and healthcare improvements. Welcome to my website, where I share my projects, skills, and journey in the world of data analytics!
